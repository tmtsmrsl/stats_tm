# stats_tm

This package can visualize binomial, poisson, normal and student's T distributions; and calculate their probability mass or density function along with their cumulative probability. The documentation and API reference are availble here: https://tmtsmrsl.github.io/stats_tm_docs.html

## Background
The objective of this project is to apply object-oriented programming, unit test, exception handling, code documentation, and a bit of math. No external statistics library is used, so the unit test is crucial to make sure all of the formulas were written correctly.
